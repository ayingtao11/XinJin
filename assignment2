/*  Description
 * Main class that has main method,I tried to use it as demo; it calls all of other classes
 * to check if the programming is working.
 * However my drJava in my pc cannot read file directly, it shows:
 * java.io.FileNotFoundException: regional-global-weekly-2020-02-07--2020-02-14 (The system cannot find the file specified)
 * even i downloaded the lists from the website as you told me in class.
 * Both of scanner and bufferedreader do not work
 * I fixed all compiler errors but I'm not sure if it can run.
